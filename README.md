Agile:

This project was created using Agile principles using a Kanban board I created on Github. This method has helped me priories and organise each step clearly.

Design Choices
Colour Scheme: 

#f8eff4
rgb(147, 125, 125)


Typography: Playfair Display (from google fonts)

Priority Features:

Splash page:
This is an introductory screen a user sees when visiting the website. I have created a fun animation to create the look and feel of the website that you can click on to get to the homepage. 

Home page:

This is where an introduction to the website is stated and has a list of all recently posted work by other artists that you can scroll through and explore. 

Registration:
This allows users to sign up to the service which will allow them to upload their own work and create feedback for other artist’s work.

Sign In:

A page for users to sign in which will enable them to add posts, delete and edit. Add feedback to other people’s posts

Mediums:
This is in the form of a dropdown menu in the navbar. You can select an artist medium to see which artworks have been posted in ta particular category.

Add post:
this allows you to add a post and categorise it by medium which will then appear on the home page. You have the option to delete and edit your post at any time. 

Future features:

I have not included a footer because this is a stand alone platform that does not have any links to social media. If the website evolved to have different branches on social media platforms, then this could be added at a later date. 

Have the option to create a profile for each artist.

Have an option to add other artists profiles.

provide a chat function for artists to communicate with eachother about upcoming exhibitions and collaborations.

Validation 


Responsiveness:

The site is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes. I used the dev tools on chrome to test the website for responsiveness. I captured screenshots to demonstrate responsive design across mobile, tablet and laptop based on the size configurations preset in dev tools.

 Testing and Validation
I used the W3 HTML Validator to check the HTML on each of my site pages by Direct Input. I have resolved the necessary errors (extra tags and correcting how width is set in an img tag). However there are some error messages remaning which are due to the content being created using Django Summernote editor in the admin panel.

I used the W3 CSS Validator to check my CSS script by Direct Input. I found no errors! There are 5 warnigns which are just flagging vendor extensions.

CSS validation results

I used the CI Python Linter to check all my python scripts. I found a few small errors like the below - mostly lines were too long or there was a missing blank space line. I have left some of the error messages as they are related to a too long line at the result of a comment.

I also used the Django automated testing within my Gitpod workspace.

Credit: 

I used I think therefore I blog resource in lms but I found it a little difficult to follow comprehend in parts, so I also used a couple of youtube tutorials which were helpful:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA4X73E_HV0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhBWzXVJ5so

I used slack and chat gpt to help me with error messages in the terminal.

The images are some of my own artwork and others are of friends’ work and google images.

Wireframes were made using balsamiq



Some extra notes

Due to database issues, our cohort was given extra time to complete the project. I  was unable to take advantage of the extra time due to prior engagements for the entire following week, therefore I had to opt for the late submission option and upon my return I was left with very little time to make adjustments to my project.

I later discovered that it was bad developer practise to name my apps in capital letters. By the time I was privy to this information, I had already almost completed my project and would be too late to start again. The Django cheat sheet we were provided with was very misleading, where it says to set up the project apps, it has examples in capitals. This is very misleading. I know not to do this in future and will definitely not be doing this again.

I encountered a big issue where my logout function had come up with an error. It was all working perfectly up until this point, the database went down again on the morning of submission, which took up crucial time. I would have liked to have had the time to be more thorough with validation. 

I had a problem with images for deployment, I had figured this out just at the end but it was too close to submission time
